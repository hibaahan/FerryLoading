# FerryLoading
We successfully implemented a solution to the **Ferry Loading Problem** using backtracking. Initially, we utilized a **Big Table** for memoization, which worked but was not the most efficient approach. We later optimized the solution by employing a **Hash Table**, significantly improving performance. The final solution was uploaded to the Virtual Judge and accepted.

For more details about how the code works and the hash function used in the second solution, please refer to the report, which is available in French.
